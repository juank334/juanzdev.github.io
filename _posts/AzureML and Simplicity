If you think Azure ML is the solution for the machine learning problems for the common user think again, Azure ML is great in fact
is the first SaaS for machine learning on the cloud, here you have a dashboard and a bunch of tools to drag to. You can get a 
quick start by using their templates, is simple just drag an input source, then a transformation box select some columns, filter some text
split the data to another transofmration component, then pass it to a neural network then drag the train component, hit run
and the neural network is trained, easy eh? I dont think so!, not so fast. First of all i think is very important to remark that 
all the users of this tool need to know the machine learning concepts to be able to confirue correctly each element
Azure ml does a wondefull job at exposing all this machine learning artifacts, my point is that you need know what you are doing!
Fore example you need to understand your iput data and your hyperparameters, how much?
