## Perceptron
In Machine Learning to know the history and the inner workings of the perceptrons is important because it could be said that is the first architecture that tries to learn patterns with inputs of data.

The perceptron is a network that receives multiples fixed inputs of data specifically numbers, those inputs are connected to a special neuron by a set of synapses or weighs, the neuron will calculate a weighed sum over the inputs and the wieghs and will perform an activation function in this case a binary one.

The mathematical definition of the perceptron goes like this:
**formula**

In machine learning we call this functions score functions, because they gives us some unique number from multiple inputs they gives us a score, in this case because our neuron is a binary neuron it will gives us 1 or 0.
