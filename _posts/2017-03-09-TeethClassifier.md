## A New Post

In this blog post I'm going to explain how you can create a complete machine learning system for teeth detection over a face, I will show the main challenges that I faced implementing this task.

Main challenges:
1. Finding data where people are showing their teeth or not
2. Label the data accordingly ( 1 for showing teeth, 0 not showing teeth)
3. Detect the face region in an image
4. Detect the principal landmarks on the face
5. Transform the face with the detected landmarks to have a "frontal face"
6. Highlight the teeth on the face
3. Augment data for posterior training
