## A New Post

In this blog post I'm going to explain how you can create a complete system in Machine Learning that will be able to detect wether or not a person is showing his teeth.
This problems impose different challenges:
1. Finding data where people are showing their teeth and also not showing their teeth
2. Label the data accordingly
2.Detect the face in an image
2. Help the machine learning model highlighitng the teeth on the picture
