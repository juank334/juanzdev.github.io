Our primary goal in machine learning is to predict a value based on a problem or an ouput variable, this value can be discrete or continous.

## Discrette
When the output variable can be described or classifed in groups then we can say that the variable is discrette, for example our machine learning algorithm predicts wether tomorrow is going to rain or not, here our universe of choises is only reduces to two (yes or no) 

## Continous
When the output variable can have an infinte range of values we say the variable is continus, for example our machine learning algorithm predicts the temperature of tomorrows day, this value can be 10 degrees or 11 degrees or maybe 10.1 or 10.12 this range is infinite if you think about it.

When a machine learning algorithm outputs a discrette variable we say this algorithm tackles a classification problem.

When a machine learning algorithm outputs a continous variable we say this algorithm tackles a regression problem.
