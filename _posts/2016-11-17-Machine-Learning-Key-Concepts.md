## Generalization
When you train a machine learning algorithm we know that the input data is changing the internal values of the model, you can train a machine learing algorithm with you data so well that the model can produce an exact output function that resembles exactly as the training set, this can be risky because your goal is to be able to identify the hidden rule that describes your data, if your model can deduce this hidden rule then the model will be able to behave very well on unseen data, the capability of the model to deduce this hidden rule is what is called generalization, because your model was trained on the training set but was able to learn the rules that describe the data very well, the model generalizes well.

## Overfitting
When you train a machine learning algorithm with small amounts of data or maybe with bad data your model after training will try to describe your training set exactly as it is, this is bad because your model must be prepared to see unseen data on real world problems, in this case your model is so thighted to the training set that at the end is unpractical to use it on new data, a common way to overcome overfitting is to gatther much more data or ease the learned function. 

## Underfitting
When you want to train a machine learning model with some data, and this data is kind of complex (maybe is too much data or the hidden rule is too complex to learn) and you choose a simple learning model it can happen that the model although we have lots of data is incapable of learning the complex relationships that describes the data, in this case is too hard for the choosen model to come up with a result function, a common way to overcome underfitting is to change the choosen model with more complex ones.

## Parameter
A parameter is a changing value of a statistical learning model, the parameter will be adjusted with greater values or leesser values on the training process, at the end when you have a machine learning model ready for production it means the configured parameters represents the final and optimal solution that you were looking for.

## Hyperparameter
An hyperparameter is a configuration value that you can make to a statistical machine learning model, in machine learning there are a bunch of statistical models, this models have also some configurations for example one statistical model is neural networks, an hyperparameter in this case could be the number of neurons that it has per layer or the total number of layers.

## Bias

## Variance
