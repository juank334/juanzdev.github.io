## A New Post

In this blog post I will explain how you can implement a Word Embeddings implementation in Caffe using Bengio Neural Model and based on Hinton Coursera course code in Octave.


A neural network is compossed of what is called hidden layers, the state of this layers will be unknown at training time and they are very usefull because they somehow represents our input with different feature repressentations.

By working with different feature representations very abstract associations, for example when training a classifier of pictures we can create boundaries in high dimensional space to group "concepts" of pictures and to be able to differentiate how similar or diferent a picture is to other picture.
