## SVM Loss
When you want to fit a statistical model to some training data you can use the SVM Loss technique.
SVM loss is a loss function that tries to score the training set , lets remember that the training set is composed of the data as it is and the labels clasifiying the data.

The SVM loss function gives your weight matrix a score number in this case 0 is good and higher is bad, the way that the loss function gives us this number is by iterating over the dot product between X and W, especifically it states that:

(formula here)

To be more clear, lets remember that each row on the weights matrix corresponds to a diferent classifier. When the dot product happens between X and W the resulting matrix is the "predicted" results using our random weights.

this formula tells us then based on this resulting matrix and having into account that each row in W is a distinct classifier that:

for each input value this is a image and we know the correct class classification (this is yi) our current weights will have an error dependeing on the following logic

iterating over all the possible classifiers
