Every single moment our brain is being exposed to light, sound, touch, smells and all kind of experiencies. It turns out that our brain does an outstanding job at getting familirized with all this new information, somehow it can interpret any kind of signal and remember it at any point of time, thanks to our memory capabilities and pattern recognition abilities we can somehow understand and remember abstract concepts from previous experiences.

## Natural Pattern Recognition

Let me give you a clear example of this. For example a human baby doesnt know a lot of things about this world, like what a car is or what a TV is, but the day-by-day exposure to the enviroment will eventually help him understand more and more what he is seeing. For example his mother will point out objects and saying what the object is (lets say a car), the baby without realizing is associating the abstract concept of that object with the sound of "car", his eyes capture a very unique shape with rectangles and circles, colors and sizes, all of this is being captured and being associated inside our heads.

So our brain is exposed every day with tons of information, and if you take into account the number of seconds a human lives, thats a ton of information to learn things for!.

## The Problem  of Computer Visual Pattern Recognition

If we want to create computer programs with such pattern recognition capabilities we need to start thinking how to program a pattern recognition program engine that could handle all the information of the real world the same as our brain does.

For engineers and software developers to create computer programs that emulate the same recognition capabilities of our brains has been a topic of research for over the last 50 years. It is a very challenging task to create something that evolution has perfectionated over the centuries.

When you think in how to create a program that could recognize the shape of a car from an image it is almost imposible to think in if-else statements or  to think in some special techique using a 3rd generation language programming like Java or C#. And it turns out that image recognition before machine learning used this brute force methods with classsic programming techniques  that are actually pretty clever if you think about them, but still feels like a very hard thing to do and not a very natural way to solve the problem.

If you think at a deep level from the computational perspective, the ability to recognize the concept of a car from an image is the same ability to recognize the pattern of a car in a set of color pixels aka recognize a pattern of an object in a set of data.

If there were a way to create a program that could recognize patterns from data in the best way possible what will be this implementation? What programming techniques will use? Should we use loops? Recursion? If-then statements? Some fancy technique? 
It turns out that this question is very hard to answer, in fact almost impossible to answer these days,  we dont have a method(thinking in code statements) or technique to create a program that could do such task at least with human performance level.
