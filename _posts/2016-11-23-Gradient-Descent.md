## What is Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is a very usefull algorithm in machine learning and mathematics because it allows your calculate the local minima or maxima of a function, lets remember that a function can be represented on a plot as a plane or hyperplane depending of the number of variables it has, this plane can be imagined as a nature horizon with mountains going up and holes going down, each point on the plane is the result of the function evaluated on some specific values for the  independent variables. The goal here is to look at the highest point on a plane or the lower,  this problem is called finding the global minima or global maxima, gradient descent can help us finding not the global minima or optima but the local minima or optima, it has been proven that finding a local minima or optima is enough for tacke real world problems on machine learning.
