## Machine Learning Tokyo Meetup

Its been four months since I have been living in Tokyo, currently Im working for a Japanese company for some machine learning consultancy. I was very curious about the software development movement here in tokyo, specially machine learning. Japan is well known worldwide for robotics and hardware innovations, i was wondering if is as good for modern AI. So I start searching for machine learning meetups and I come across a group called Deep learning otemachi group, so after work I decided to see and check their talks at maronouchi building near Tokyo station.

The event is actually hosted by a company called Preferred Networks, they have been promoting machine learning talks here in tokyo.

The event overall was very interesting for me, lots of great projects were discussed from people around the world with they whish to share the results with the comunity, I was impressed.
