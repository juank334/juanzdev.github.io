## Machine Learning Tokyo Meetup

Its been four months since I have been living in Tokyo, currently Im working for a Japanese company for some machine learning consultancy. I was very curious about the software development movement here in tokyo, specially machine learning. Japan is well known worldwide for robotics and hardware innovations, i was wondering if is as good for modern AI. So I start searching for machine learning meetups and I come across a group called Deep learning otemachi group, so after work I decided to see and check their talks at maronouchi building near Tokyo station.
