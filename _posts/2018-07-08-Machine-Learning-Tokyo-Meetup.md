## Machine Learning Tokyo Meetup

Its been four months since I have been living in Tokyo, currently Im working for a Japanese company for some machine learning consultancy. I was very curious about the software development movement here in tokyo, specially machine learning. Japan is well known worldwide for robotics and hardware innovations, i was wondering if is as good for modern AI. So I start searching for machine learning meetups and I come across a group called Deep learning otemachi group, so after work I decided to see and check their talks at maronouchi building near Tokyo station.

The event is actually hosted by a company called Preferred Networks, they have been promoting machine learning talks here in tokyo.

The event overall was very interesting for me, lots of great projects were discussed from people around the world with they whish to share the results with the comunity, I was impressed.

Here is the list of the very interesting projects that were discuessed, overall I like a lot this talks, they were very technical and the speakers were very open to answer those questions, the most valuable thing I found was how they discuss the deep learning architectures and what challenges they found during the development process.

When you arrive the meetup you can grab as many snacks and japanese drinks as you like ;), before start listening to some complex deeplearnign I think my head needed some japanese whiskey to start catching the ideas better.

Alpaca's pipeline for real-time market forecasting

The first talk was given by Paul and Remy, two french engineers that were very knoledable about time series analysis, they explained in great detail  how to use deep learning techniques to predict market behaviors, they talk about how the Alpaca company were successfull on real time market analysis using RNNs for time sensitive predictions, this core functionallity is part of todays Bloombergs client application for market forecasting.

Interactively Picking Real-World Objects with Unconstrained Spoken Language Instructions
This talk discussed and end-to-end approach for object detection using SSM along with a couple of NLP techniques (see architecture below) attached to a robot arm. The overall system was able to listen to your commands and grab any item from the four squared areas and put the mentioned object on the desired position. This sistem uses NLP to understand the semantics in your sentence command eg (move the rounded object next to the smartphone), along with a RNN for speech recognition, along with a CNN + SSM for object detection, the system was an end to end solution using multiple stacked layers of neural networks. The result is very cool.
